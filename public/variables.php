    <p>Here at Survival Straps&trade; we custom build each piece of gear based on your exact wrist measurement. We want the size of your wrist, not the length you would like the bracelet.We ask that you follow these 3 steps closely:
      <ol>
        <li>Take a tape measure, string, or scotch tape and wrap it around your wrist to where the two ends touch and there isn't any slack. Keep in mind this doesn't need to be so tight that it cuts off your circulation, but merely a true wrist size without slack.</li>
        <li>Mark this exact length on your string and use a ruler to determine your true wrist size. Order this exact wrist size when checking out, and you are good to go!</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h6>Side Notes</h6>
    <p>If you are in-between sizes, round down to the nearest size. Please remember not to compensate for slack as we do that here in-house based on your true size. Lastly, if you have any questions for our team please shoot us an email at <a href=mailto: customerservice@survivalstraps.com>customerservice@survivalstraps.com</a> or give us a ring at 1-800-971-3360 and we will gladly walk through the steps with you.</p>
